# swiftToDoApp2
Second attempt at a To Do App in Swift
* This is a To Do List app in Swift. It has multiple view controllers, and the ability to store and delete information. 
* Fairly easy design but I'd like to update in the future

## Things to do for my ToDo App
* Find Background image
* Use a more interesting font
* Possible Animation for transition
* Have fun with adding new items
* Have fun reaction when checking off items
* Implement a check off rather than simple deletion of items when done
